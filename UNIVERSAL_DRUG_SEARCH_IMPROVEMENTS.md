# Universal Drug Search Improvements

## Overview
The Healthcare Investment Intelligence Platform now supports searching for ANY drug name, not just those in our database. This ensures a seamless user experience regardless of whether we have pre-existing data for a drug.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Drug Database**
- Added 20+ popular drugs including:
  - GLP-1 agonists: Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy
  - Biologics: Enbrel, Remicade, Dupixent
  - Cardiovascular: Entresto, Jardiance, Farxiga
  - Immunology: Rinvoq, Xeljanz, Ocrevus
  - And many more...

### 2. **Universal Search Support**
- **Unknown Drugs**: Any drug not in our database is handled gracefully
- **Automatic Suggestions**: Shows popular drugs when search results are limited
- **Clear Visual Indicators**:
  - ðŸŸ¡ **New** badge for unknown drugs
  - ðŸ”µ **Popular** badge for suggested drugs
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Company** badge for ticker searches

### 3. **Fixed PostType Comparison Error**
- Resolved the enum comparison issue in sentiment analysis
- Changed `Counter(m.post_type for m in mentions)` to `Counter(m.post_type.value for m in mentions)`

### 4. **Improved Search Experience**
```javascript
// Search now handles:
1. Known drugs in database
2. Unknown drugs (any text â‰¥3 characters)
3. Company tickers (2-5 uppercase letters)
4. Partial matches and variations
```

### 5. **Graceful Fallbacks**
- Unknown drugs display as:
  - Drug Name: User's input (title-cased)
  - Company: "Unknown Company"
  - Ticker: "N/A"
- Analysis proceeds with simulated data for unknown drugs

## Examples

## Benefits

3. **Flexibility**: Can analyze any pharmaceutical product
4. **Better Discovery**: Popular drugs suggested to help users

## Future Enhancements
