## ðŸ“ž Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No market data appearing:**
- Check yfinance is installed: `pip install yfinance`
- Verify ticker mapping in enhanced_features.py

**Charts not rendering:**
- Install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib seaborn`
- Check browser supports embedded images

**Slow performance:**
- Reduce parallel workers in config
- Use caching for repeated analyses
- Consider upgrading to paid API tiers

### Performance Optimization

For large-scale analysis:
```bash
# Use Redis for caching
redis-server

# Run with caching enabled
python3 main_enhanced.py --use-cache --cache-ttl 3600
```
