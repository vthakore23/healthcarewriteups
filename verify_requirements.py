        BioTech Corp (NASDAQ: BTCH) today announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 BREAKTHROUGH trial 
        evaluating BTH-123 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study met its primary 
        endpoint of overall survival with a statistically significant improvement compared to standard chemotherapy.
        
        In the trial of 850 patients, BTH-123 demonstrated a median overall survival of 24.5 months compared to 
        16.2 months for chemotherapy (HR=0.65, p<0.001). The progression-free survival was 11.3 months versus 
        6.8 months (HR=0.58, p<0.001). The overall response rate was 47% for BTH-123 versus 23% for chemotherapy.
        
        The safety profile was consistent with previous studies. The most common adverse events were fatigue (34%), 
        nausea (28%), and decreased appetite (22%). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 42% of patients on BTH-123 
        versus 68% on chemotherapy. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 12% versus 25%.
        
        "These results represent a significant advancement for lung cancer patients," said Dr. Jane Smith, Chief 
        Medical Officer. "BTH-123 offers a new treatment option with improved efficacy and better tolerability."
        
        BioTech plans to file for FDA approval in Q2 2024 and has already initiated discussions with regulatory 
        authorities in Europe and Japan. The company estimates the global NSCLC market could reach $15 billion by 2028.
        
        In addition to the BREAKTHROUGH trial, BioTech is conducting Phase 2 trials of BTH-123 in colorectal and 
        pancreatic cancer. The company also announced a collaboration with MegaPharma to develop combination therapies.
